                <P class="intro">
                Neptune is the furthest-known Solar System planet from the sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third most of massive planet, and the densest giant planet . It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.

                <p>
                Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly, its equational clouds take 16 hours to make one rotation. This is because Neptune is not solid body. The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. The methane absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear lovely blue. Neptune has a very active climate and has 14 moons, the most interesting moon is Triton, a frozen world that is spewing nitrogen ice and dust particles out from below its surface.
